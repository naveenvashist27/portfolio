        <h3>Project 1</h3>
        <p>I had the opportunity to complete a 45-day internship at the Indore Municipal Corporation under the
          Internship with Mayor program. During this period, I worked as a Frontend Developer and actively contributed
          to a Google Maps-based web development project aimed at enhancing the city‚Äôs digital infrastructure. My
          responsibilities included designing user interfaces, improving user experience, and collaborating with a team
          to integrate real-time location data.

          As a coordinator for the project, I also gained experience in team management and cross-functional
          communication. With mentorship from senior developers and professionals, I enhanced my skills in HTML, CSS,
          and began exploring backend technologies. This internship not only strengthened my technical capabilities but
          also gave me hands-on experience in solving real-world problems through technology for public service. </p>

        <h3>Project 2</h3>
        <p>completed a web development internship at DebugShala, where I worked on real-world projects and honed my
          skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and modern development tools. Under the mentorship of Bhavesh Joshi and Albin
          Xavier Varghese, I gained practical experience in front-end development, responsive design, and code
          optimization.

          Throughout the internship, I contributed to live projects, participated in code reviews, and collaborated with
          a team of developers to solve real-time challenges. This experience enhanced not only my technical proficiency
          but also my problem-solving abilities and understanding of the software development lifecycle.

          My time at DebugShala helped me transition from theoretical knowledge to industry-level application, making me
          more confident and prepared for future tech roles.

          and began exploring backend technologies. This internship not only strengthened my technical capabilities but
          also gave me hands-on experience in solving real-world problems through technology for public service. </p>
